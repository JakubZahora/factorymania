Hello! Welcome to my FactoryMania Project.

To launch it locally:

1. Make sure you have node.js installed on your device.
2. Navigate to project folder using terminal/powershell.
3. Start local server by using "npm start"

All dependancies and packages used can be found in "server.js" as well as "package.json"
All HTML pages are in the "views" folder.
Client side javascript can be found in /public/client folder.

Thanks for bothering to look through it!

Special thanks to: Stackoverflow, GitHub, and several articles for all the help.
